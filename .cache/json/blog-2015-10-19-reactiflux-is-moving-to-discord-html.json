Shortly after, Slack decided we were too big and disabled invites. There was no way for new users to join. Many of us were sad and upset. We loved Slack.  Our community was built around it.</p>\n<p>We reached out to Slack several times, but their decision was firm. Our large community caused performance issues. Slack wants to focus on building a great product for teams, not necessarily large open communities. Losing focus and building for too many use cases always leads to product bloat, and eventually a decrease in quality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-why-discord\"><a href=\"#so-why-discord\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So… why Discord?</h2>\n<p>After a <a href=\"https://github.com/reactiflux/volunteers/issues/25\">long and thorough debate</a>, Discord quickly emerged as the most promising service. After just a few days, 400 members had joined the Discord server, and many already loved it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"easiest-to-join\"><a href=\"#easiest-to-join\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Easiest to join</h3>\n<p>Discord is the easiest platform to join. New users can immediately join our conversations without having to create an account. All they need to do is provide a name. No permission granting, no password, no email confirmation.</p>\n<p>This is critically useful for us, and will make Reactiflux even more open and accessible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"great-apps\"><a href=\"#great-apps\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Great apps</h3>\n<p>Out of all of the services we’ve tried, Discord’s apps are by far the most polished. They are well designed, easy to use, and surprisingly fast. In addition to the web app, they have mobile apps on both iOS and Android as well as desktop apps for OS X and Windows, with Linux support coming soon.</p>\n<p>Their desktop apps are built with React and Electron, and their iOS app is built with React Native.</p>\n<h3 id=\"moderation-tools\"><a href=\"#moderation-tools\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Moderation tools</h3>\n<p>So far, we’ve been fortunate not to have to deal with spammers and trolls. As our community continues to grow, that might change. Unsurprisingly, Discord is the only app we’ve seen with legitimate moderation tools. It was built for gaming communities, after all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"great-multiple-server-support\"><a href=\"#great-multiple-server-support\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Great multiple Server support</h3>\n<p>Your  Discord account works with every Discord server, which is the equivalent of a Slack team. You don’t need to create a new account every time you join a new team. You can join new servers in one click, and it’s very easy to switch between them. Discord messages also work across servers, so your personal conversations are not scoped to a single server.</p>\n<p>Instead of having one huge, crowded Reactiflux server, we can branch off closely related channels into sub-servers. Communities will start overlapping, and it will be easy to interact with non-Reactiflux channels.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-hosted\"><a href=\"#its-hosted\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>It’s hosted</h3>\n<p>Self-hosted apps require maintenance.

There are a million reasons why Discord <em>might be</em> a terrible idea. Here are the ones that we’re most worried about:</p>\n<h3 id=\"difficult-channel-management\"><a href=\"#difficult-channel-management\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Difficult channel management</h3>\n<p>Channel management seems to be the biggest issue. There is no way to opt out of channels; you can only mute them. And you can only mute channels one by one. There is no way to star channels, and channels can only be sorted on the server level. Each user will see the list of channels in the same order.</p>\n<p>As the number of channels grow, it will be challenging to keep things in order. Branching off sub-servers will help, and we will keep an easily accessible directory of channels across our main server and all of the sub-servers.</p>\n<p>We can build simple tools to make channel lookup easier, and the Discord team is working on improvements that should make this more manageable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-search\"><a href=\"#no-search\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>No Search</h3>\n<p>Lack of search is clearly a bummer, but Discord is working on it.
