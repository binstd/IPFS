In order to make sure attendees get a fair shot at\nregistering, we’re going to sell tickets in three separate first-come,\nfirst-serve phases. <strong>Tickets will cost $200 regardless of which phase they are\npurchased from and all proceeds will go to charity</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Friday November 28th 2014 — Noon PST: First wave of tickets</li>\n<li>Friday December 5th 2014 — Noon PST: Second wave of tickets</li>\n<li>Friday December 12th 2014 — Noon PST: Third and last wave of tickets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We really do wish that everyone could attend React.js Conf, but in order to\nensure a quality experience for those who attend, we feel it will be best to\nlimit the size of the conference to what was originally planned for. This means\nthat not everyone who wants to attend will be able to, and many talks that\nwould be excellent contributions to the conference will have to be postponed\nuntil the next conference. All the talks will be recorded and put online shortly after.</p>\n<p>We hope to see many of you at React.js Conf this January.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>React Core Team</p>","excerpt":"Yesterday was the  React.js Conf  call for presenters submission deadline.
