Hopefully we don’t need to use it, but moving forward we’ll set up a little bit more process to ensure the safety of our users. Ember.js has <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/security/\">an excellent policy</a> which we may use as our model.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the vulnerability discussed here: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/OIqxlB2aGfU\">CVE-2013-7035</a>.</p>","excerpt":"Today we’re releasing an update to address a potential XSS vulnerability that can\t arise when using user data as a  .
