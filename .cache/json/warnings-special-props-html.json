{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Most props on a JSX element are passed on to the component, however, there are two special props (<code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">ref</code> and <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">key</code>) which are used by React, and are thus not forwarded to the component.</p>\n<p>For instance, attempting to access <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">this.props.key</code> from a component (i.e., the render function or <a href=\"/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html#proptypes\">propTypes</a>) is not defined. If you need to access the same value within the child component, you should pass it as a different prop (ex: <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">&lt;ListItemWrapper key={result.id} id={result.id} /&gt;</code>). While this may seem redundant, itâ€™s important to separate app logic from reconciling hints.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Special Props Warning","next":null,"prev":null},"fields":{"path":null,"slug":"warnings/special-props.html"}}},"pathContext":{"slug":"warnings/special-props.html"}}
