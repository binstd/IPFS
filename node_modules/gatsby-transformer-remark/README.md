There are many Gatsby Remark plugins which you can install to customize how Markdown is processed. Many of them are demoed at https://using-remark.gatsbyjs.org/. See also the [source code for using-remark](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-remark).

## Parsing algorithm

It recognizes files with the following extensions as Markdown:

- md
- rmd
- mkd
- mkdn
- mdwn
- mdown
- litcoffee
- markdown

Each Markdown file is parsed into a node of type `MarkdownRemark`.

All frontmatter fields are converted into GraphQL fields. TODO link to docs on
auto-inferring types/fields.

This plugin adds additional fields to the `MarkdownRemark` GraphQL type
including `html`, `excerpt`, `headings`, etc. Other Gatsby plugins can also add
additional fields.

## How to query

A sample GraphQL query to get MarkdownRemark nodes:

```graphql
{
  allMarkdownRemark {
    edges {
      node {
        html
        headings {
          depth
          value
        }
        frontmatter {
          # Assumes you're using title in your frontmatter.
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
