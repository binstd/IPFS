* **[Neutrino React components preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react-components/)**: Create generic React components and preview them without the need to embed in an application.

* **[React Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos)**: Dev tool for creating reusable React components. It scans your project for components and enables you to: render components in different states, mock dependencies (API, localStorage, etc.), see app state evolve in real time.
* **[Bit](https://github.com/teambit/bit)**: Isolate and share components from existing projects to make them available to install in other projects while tracking changes across projects. It helps save the overhead of keeping components in separate repositories.
